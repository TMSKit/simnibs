Gmsh is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL), Version 2 or later, with the following exception:

  The copyright holders of Gmsh give you permission to combine Gmsh
  with code included in the standard release of TetGen (from Hang 
  Si), Netgen (from Joachim Sch"oberl), METIS (from George Karypis
  at the University of Minnesota), OpenCASCADE (from Open CASCADE
  S.A.S) and ParaView (from Kitware, Inc.) under their respective
  licenses. You may copy and distribute such a system following the
  terms of the GNU GPL for Gmsh and the licenses of the other code
  concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other
  code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

  Note that people who make modified versions of Gmsh are not
  obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
  versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General
  Public License gives permission to release a modified version
  without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to
  release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
