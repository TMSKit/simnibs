Changelog
===========
4.1.0 
------
 * Tetrahedral quality of the meshes was increased substantially to improve numerical accuracy of the FEM calculations and remove outliers in the calculated electric fields
 * Option added to use white matter and pial surfaces from FreeSurfer for more accurate representation of smaller sulci in the head meshes
 * I/O functions for neuronavigation data have been updated to support new Brainsight version 2.5.3

NOTES & Known issues: see 4.0.0
 
4.0.1
------
  * changed Brainsight position import/export to support only NIfTI:Aligned (to avoid ambiguities)
  * small bug fixes

4.0.0
------
 * New head segmentation and meshing pipeline *charm* with improved accuracy and robustness
 * Many new TMS coil models
 * New head models with additional tissue types, in particular spongy bone and large blood vessels
 * New flexible meshing approach to simplify manual editing and inclusion of custom tissue types in the head mesh
 * New command line tool *meshmesh* to support meshing of custom geometries
 * Support of Nx1 center-surround montages in python and Matlab
 * Added python examples for temporal interference simulations using pre-calculated leadfields for speed
 * Added basic I/O functions for neuronavigation data in python
 * Update to python 3.9
 * Major code cleanup and restructuring under the hood
 * Tested on Windows 10, Linux and Macs with Intel and Apple Silicon
 * Headreco and mri2mesh are deprecated.
 
NOTE: Simnibs 4 is NOT backwards compatible. Head models created with charm cannot be used in older versions. Head models from older versions need to be converted using the command line tool *convert_3_to_4* for use with SimNIBS 4.
 
Known issues:
 * Installation fails on paths with non-standard characters, such as backslash, chinese characters, ... (workaround: provide another path)
 * simnibs_gui does not start on some linux systems, e.g. with wayland (workaround: ld preloading of libstdc++.so.6 seems to help; example: export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 - path needs to be adjusted according to library path on local system)
 * The PARDISO solver (available as option for the FEM calculations) does not work on Apple Silicon
 
3.2.6
------
* fixed a bug causing headreco to fail on MacOS
* Note: On Apple M1s using .ccd coil files does not yet work, please use niftis instead.

3.2.5
------
* added skin smoothing options for TMS optimization
* more informative matlab error messages
* small bug fixes

3.2.4
------
 * Small bug fix related to gmsh options.

3.2.3
------
 * Gmsh version changed to avoid issues with Big Sur (only MacOS)
 * Headreco bug fixes to make meshing more stable in the eye region and air cavities
 * Added a Nx1 example for a center-surround electrode montage

3.2.2
------
 * Added matlab and python examples for TACSchallenge
 * Added matlab examples to calculate TI amplitudes
 * TMS optimization now prints optimal position in log file
 * Added reading of leadfields in mesh_load_hdr5.m
 * Added work-around to enable installation on Mac OS 11 Big Sur; NOTE: If you attempted to install a previous version of SimNIBS 3.2, you have to wipe the installation folder (in "/Users/username/Applications/SimNIBS-3.2" before attempting to install again; NOTE: This work-around is temporary and will be removed once the issues in the underlying python packages have been resolved
 * Changed the skin smoothing iterations in headreco from 5 to 20, which should result in a smoother skin surface. Note: this changes the standard behavior of headreco, so results might differ slightly.
 * Per default, headreco does not print the cat summary pdf anymore. The --cat_no_print flag was removed; Instead, use --cat_print now in case you need the summary.


Bug fixes:
 * TDCS Network Optimization: Fixed bugs to accept images with NaNs, binary images, and images of size NxMxKx1; weights of eyes are now set to 0.
 * Added buffered read for gmsh v2 files in python to resolve speed issue on clusters
 * Resolved a bug causing some points of the individual middle gm surface to be falsely interpreted as outside gm when interpolating results to individual gm surface
 * Further small fixes across the code
 * Fixed electrode meshing that sometimes caused some parts of the electrodes to be detached.

 
Known issues:
 * mri2mesh does not work with Freesurfer 7; please use Freesurfer 6 for now
 * SimNIBS is so far not tested on Macs with Apple Silicon, and is likely to give errors on those machines
