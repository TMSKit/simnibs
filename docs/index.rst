=============
 SimNIBS 4.5
=============


**SimNIBS v4.5** is an open source software package for the Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation. It allows for realistic calculations of the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES).

A basic SimNIBS workflow consists of three main parts:

   * :ref:`Generate high-quality head models <head_modeling_tutorial>` from MR images.

   * Set up and run simulation using our fast FEM solvers in the :ref:`graphical user interface <gui_tutorial>`, or via :ref:`MATLAB or Python scripts <scripting_tutorial>`.

   * :ref:`Visualize simulation results <visualization_tutorial>`, and easily transform them to *FsAverage* or *MNI* space via in-built functions.

SimNIBS offers several advanced options such as :ref:`Optimizations of TMS coil positions <overview_tms_opt>`, or several :ref:`TES optimization methods <overview_tes_opt>` supporting single and multiple targets, brain network targeting and flexible leadfield-free optimization. 

Also a number of :ref:`external open-source software packages and workflows <external_packages>` build upon SimNIBS.
