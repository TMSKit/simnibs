Coil Models Included in SimNIBS
==================================


Default Coil Files
-------------------

Please use the files in the coil_models subfolder *Drakaki_BrainStim_2022*. They were reconstructed from direct measurements of their fields, making them quite accurate. Further details, including maximal dI/dt values at 100% MSO, are listed in the corresponding publication.

Previous Coil Files
-------------------

The two previously included models of the Magstim 70mm and MagVenture MC-B70 Figure-of-Eight coils can be found in subfolder *legacy_and_other*. They were constructed based on X-ray images.

Extra Coil Files

We would like to thank Zhi-De Deng for sharing his coil definition files with us and Mursel Karadas for converting them to SimNIBS format.
These models were constructed from geometrical values about the coil windings taken from literature.
Please note that some of the models represent non-planar coils.
Setting the coil position for those in the SimNIBS GUI can easily result in the simulation of physically impossible coil placements,
i.e. corresponding to parts of the coil being inside the head, and are only meant for expert use!

Note (29.8.22)
''''''''''''''

The coil model "No9_H1.nii.gz" is inaccurate, mainly (but not only) because it is left-right mirrored. We are looking into ways to provide a more accurate model of that coil.
